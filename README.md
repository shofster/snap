GO/fyne.io Desktop Application (by Bob)

"snap" creates PDFs (.pdf) files consisting of images for the files in
 one (or more) directories.

Files with images (.jpg, .png, .gif, and .mp3 w/cover image) are represented
 by their respective content.
Other files are displayed as a thumbnail for the general type of that file.

Up to 35 thumbnails (5 x 7) are displayed per PDF page. One or more directories
 may be chosen - with each directory starting a new page in the output PDF.

"snap" uses a console to accept typed commands.

The commands (followed by <enter>) are:
  x - eXit  or (q) Quit 
  l - List the current selected PATHs
  a - Add 1 or more PATHs
  c - Clear the PATHs
  p - generate a PDF file
  h - Help

The "Add" commmand starts a 1 or many directory selection window.

The "PDF" command asks for an output directory and file name for the
(to be) generated PDF file.
